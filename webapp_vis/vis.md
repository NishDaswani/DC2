## Slide 3: Our Approach & Methodology
Visualization:
* Simple pipeline diagram or flowchart(e.g., “Data → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Forecast → Allocation”)
Why:
* Helps non-technical stakeholders understand the workflow at a glance
* Shows your process is structured, systematic, and aligned with operational goals

## Slide 5: Insights from Our Data Exploration
Visualizations:
1. Line plot of monthly burglary counts (city-wide)Shows seasonality, COVID dip, upward/downward trends
    * Why: Highlights predictable temporal patterns — validates why forecasting makes sense
2. Heatmap or choropleth map of average burglary rates per LSOA or ward
    * Why: Communicates spatial variation in risk — “hotspot” concept becomes visually intuitive
3. Correlation matrix or bar chart of feature correlationsE.g., rental rate vs. burglary, deprivation vs. burglary
    * Why: Shows stakeholders which area characteristics drive risk — builds trust in chosen features

## Slide 6: Preliminary Model Results
Visualizations:
1. Actual vs. Predicted plot (scatter or line)
    * Why: Demonstrates model performance — intuitive even for non-technical viewers (points near diagonal = good)
2. RMSE or MAE bar chart across different models
    * Why: Quickly conveys which model performs best, justifies your choice (e.g., XGBoost over ARIMA)
3. Feature importance bar chart (from SHAP or built-in model importance)
    * Why: Proves transparency — shows what the model “relies on” to make predictions (e.g., not just crime history)

## Slide 7: Ethical Framework
Visualizations:
1. SHAP summary plot (beeswarm or bar plot)
    * Why: Proves you checked model interpretability; highlights whether features like deprivation are being used fairly
2. Example of buffer-based deployment map or tiered threshold diagram (optional)
    * Why: Visually communicates your patrol rules are not harsh cutoffs — smoother, fairer allocation

## Slide 8: Final Product Demo / Mock-up
Visualizations:
1. Static or interactive dashboard mock-up(Map of London LSOAs with predicted burglary risk shaded, dropdowns for boroughs)
2. Simple patrol allocation summary (e.g., table or tooltip)
    * “Ward X = high risk → deploy 40 officers”
    * “Ward Y = low risk → monitor only”
Why:
* Gives stakeholders a clear mental image of how they’d use your work
* Translates forecasts into actionable, real-world decisions
